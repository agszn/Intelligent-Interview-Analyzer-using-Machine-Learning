# Intelligent-Interview-Analyzer-using-Machine-Learning

An Intelligent Interview Analyzer using Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a system that uses machine learning techniques to analyze interviews and provide insights or predictions based on the interview data. SVM is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks and can be applied to analyze interview data to make predictions or extract meaningful information. Here's an outline of the process:

Title: Intelligent Interview Analyzer using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Introduction:
Intelligent Interview Analyzer aims to automate the analysis of interview data using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM). The system assists in evaluating interviews, predicting outcomes, and extracting valuable insights from interview data.

Data Collection:

Gather Interview Data: Collect a dataset of interview records, including the attributes or features that represent different aspects of the interviews.
Labeling: Annotate the interview data with relevant labels or outcomes, such as successful candidates, rejected candidates, or other predefined categories.
Feature Extraction and Preprocessing:

Extract Relevant Features: Identify and extract features from the interview data that are indicative of interview performance, such as verbal responses, body language, or candidate qualifications.
Normalize and preprocess the features: Scale and preprocess the extracted features to ensure compatibility with the SVM algorithm and improve the model's performance.
Training SVM Model:

Split the Dataset: Divide the labeled dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
SVM Model Selection: Select an appropriate SVM variant (e.g., linear SVM, kernel SVM) based on the characteristics of the interview data and the classification task at hand.
Feature Vector Creation: Represent each interview record as a feature vector with the extracted features.
Model Training: Train the SVM model on the labeled training data, optimizing the SVM hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained SVM model on the testing set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant metrics.
Interview Analysis and Prediction:

Feature Extraction: Extract features from the new, unseen interview data to be analyzed.
Feature Vector Creation: Represent the interview data as feature vectors using the same feature extraction process as during training.
Predictions: Apply the trained SVM model to the feature vectors to make predictions about the interview outcomes, such as candidate success or rejection.
Performance Analysis: Analyze the predictions to gain insights into the interview process, identify patterns or factors influencing success, and improve future interviews.
